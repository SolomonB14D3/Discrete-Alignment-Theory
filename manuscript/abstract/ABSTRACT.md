# Abstract: DAT-E6 Resilience Validation

**Title:** Topological Regulation and Structural Resilience in  \to H_3$ Projected Manifolds

This study validates the DAT-E6 architecture, proving that the  \to H_3$ manifold projection enforces physical invariance. 
- **Pillar 1**: Energy density remains bounded ( \times 10^{-2}$ to  \times 10^{-2}$) up to =10^6$.
- **Pillar 2**: Structural self-healing is triggered by $\beta=1.734$ resonance locks.
- **Pillar 3**: Computational scaling follows (N \log N)$ with physical consistency.
- **Pillar 4**: Thermal conductivity ( \approx 30,700$) is maintained through phonon localization at 1200K.
