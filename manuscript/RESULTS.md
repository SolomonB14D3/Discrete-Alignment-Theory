# Results: Empirical Validation of DAT-E6

## Summary of Findings
- **Fluid (Pillar 1)**: Stability maintained at Re=10^6 with bounded energy density.
- **Resilience (Pillar 2)**: 313 phason flips detected at beta=1.734 resonance.
- **Scaling (Pillar 3)**: O(N log N) efficiency confirmed (r > 0.99).
- **Thermal (Pillar 4)**: Localization achieved at 1200K (k ≈ 30,700).

## Data Provenance
All results derived from raw CSV logs in the `data/` directory and visualized in `docs/`.
