# Appendix A: Mathematical Foundations of Dynamic Alignment Theory (DAT)

## A.1 E₆ Root System in ℝ⁶
The E₆ lattice is generated by the simple roots β₁ to β₆, satisfying the Cartan matrix $C_{ij} = 2 \langle \beta_i, \beta_j \rangle / \langle \beta_i, \beta_i \rangle$. The roots are embedded in orthonormal coordinates ensuring $\langle \beta_i, \beta_i \rangle = 2$. 

The full lattice is defined as:
$$\Lambda(E_6) = \{ \sum k_i \beta_i \mid k_i \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

Truncated by the norm $\|pt\| \leq 7$, this yields exactly 2442 points invariant under the Weyl group W(E₆) of order 51,840.

## A.2 Hamiltonian Stability Analysis
The alignment potential $V(x) = \frac{k}{2} \sum \|x_i - l_i\|^2$ is quadratic and strictly convex. Its Hessian $H = kI$ is positive-definite for $k > 0$. At equilibrium ($x = l$), the gradient $\nabla V = 0$ and $H > 0$, implying local stability.

With damping $\gamma > 0$, the Langevin dynamics:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = -\nabla V - \gamma v + \eta(t)$$

dissipates energy via:
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\gamma \|v\|^2 \leq 0$$

This guarantees convergence to the global minimum (Frozen Stars) for any bounded noise $\eta(t)$.

## Appendix B: Scaling Laws for Higher-Dimensional Extensions (DAT 3.0)
To generalize the "Resonant Snap" to $E_8$ and the Leech Lattice ($\Lambda_{24}$), we implement dimensional scaling to maintain consistent Hamiltonian energy density.

### B.1 Parameter Scaling
* **Coupling Constant ($k$):** $k \propto \sqrt{d}$ to counteract volume dilution in high-dimensional manifolds.
* **Damping ($\gamma$):** $\gamma \propto 1/\sqrt{d}$ to ensure efficient dissipation without kinematic freezing.

### B.2 Hypothesis: The Density-Resilience Correlation
We hypothesize that the recovery to $\beta \approx 3.0$ (Black Noise) is accelerated in higher-rank lattices due to the deeper basins of attraction provided by increased kissing numbers ($N_{E8} = 240$, $N_{\Lambda24} = 196,560$).
