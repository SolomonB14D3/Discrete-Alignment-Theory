# Theoretical Foundations of DAT 2.0

## Pillar 1: The Discrete Substrate
Reality is modeled as a discrete, 12-fold quasicrystalline lattice projected from a 6D hypercubic parent[cite: 4, 17]. 

### Vorticity Invariant
The "impossibility" of Navier-Stokes blow-ups is resolved by the icosahedral strain cap:
$$\delta_0 = \frac{\tan(\theta/2)}{2} \approx 0.309$$ [cite: 19, 42]
The resulting invariant is defined as:
$$C = \delta_0 \cdot R \approx 3.0$$ [cite: 19, 56]

## Pillar 3: Scaling Laws
The alignment strength $A(n)$ and entropy lag $\tau_d(n)$ are governed by the golden ratio $\phi \approx 1.618$[cite: 4, 29]:
$$A(n) \approx \frac{12}{\sin(\pi/(n-\delta))}$$ [cite: 29, 56]
$$\tau_d(n) = \tau_0 \cdot \phi^{(12-|n-12|)/12}$$ [cite: 29]
