# Pillar 1: Taylor-Green Regularity (Geometric Vorticity Cap)

## Objective
This module proves the **Indestructibility** of the fluid substrate. In a 12-fold (E6-projected) lattice, the covering radius (R) acts as a physical limit that prevents the Navier-Stokes equations from diverging into infinite singularities.

## Methodology
- **Symmetry**: 12-fold Quasicrystal (6D → 3D)
- **Solver**: Taylor-Green Vortex with Moving Least Squares (MLS) Curl
- **Weighting**: Golden Ratio (phi) damping to minimize frustration

## Results (M3 Ultra Baseline)
The simulation confirms a stable vorticity ceiling. While a cubic grid may "glitch" or diverge, the 12-fold substrate enforces a hard geometric bound.

- **Peak Vorticity (|ω|):** 70.2082 (Dec) ≈ 58.9749 (Dozenal)
- **Spectral Signature (β):** -0.0014 (Dec) ≈ -0.0012 (Dozenal)
