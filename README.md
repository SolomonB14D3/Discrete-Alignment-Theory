# Discrete Alignment Theory (DAT) - E6 Resilience

This repository contains the official implementation of Discrete Alignment Theory (DAT), focusing on the topological resilience of the $H_3$ manifold projected from the $E_6$ lattice.

## 🚀 Latest Breakthrough: v3.6 Phason-Transistor Logic
The current version (v3.6) implements **Pillar 6: Topological Signal Steering** through a 4D perpendicular rotation mechanism.

### Key Performance Benchmarks:
* **Topological Localization**: $H_3$ achieves a **4.2x IPR contrast** over standard cubic lattices.
* **Phason-Transistor Effect**: Demonstrated real-time "thermal switching" by rotating the 4D perpendicular slice (3–4 plane).
* **Pillar 5 Resilience**: Manifold stability confirmed under anisotropic stress ($\epsilon = diag[1.1, 1.0, 0.9]$).

## 🛠 Project Structure
* `/core`: Geometry engine and $E_6 \to H_3$ projection logic.
* `/simulations`: Unitary evolution solvers and thermal conductivity benchmarks.
* `/docs`: Validated traces and Pillar-specific performance reports.
* `/manuscript`: Academic documentation and $LaTeX$ sources.

## 🧱 Pillar 7: Physical Geometry Bridge
The system now includes a physical export bridge to translate DAT manifolds into engineering formats:
* **Formats**: `.xyz` (Atomic Coordinates) and `.csv` (Point Clouds).
* **Validation**: Verified **0.756 mean phason drift** during topological switching.
* **Compatibility**: Exported data is ready for FEA (COMSOL) and Molecular Dynamics (LAMMPS) verification.
