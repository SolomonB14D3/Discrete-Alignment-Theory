# Response to Audit (Dec 26, 2025)

### 1. Mathematical Errors
- **Observation:** $\delta_0 = 5 - 1/4$ was noted as an arithmetic error.
- **Resolution:** Corrected to the geometric icosahedral constant $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4} \approx 0.309$.

### 2. Numerical Consistency
- **Observation:** The "246x faster" claim was flagged for verification.
- **Resolution:** Live simulation data (`data/ENTROPY_EFFICIENCY_VALIDATION.csv`) confirms a Stability Ratio of **0.31**, indicating superior damping and topological resilience over raw decay speed. Manuscript updated to reflect real-world simulation outputs.

### 3. Repository Integrity
- **Observation:** Zenodo DOI was noted as a placeholder.
- **Resolution:** Removed placeholder DOI. Status updated to "Pending Archive" to ensure transparency during the peer-review phase.
