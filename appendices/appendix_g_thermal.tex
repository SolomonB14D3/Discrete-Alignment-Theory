\textbf{Pillar 4: Phononic Mirror and Topological Heat Shield}

Aperiodic r=7 lattices create phononic bandgaps, arresting thermal flow
via destructive interference in fractal pockets (Anderson localization).
This overcomes thermodynamic "impossibility": Heat diffusion appears to
violate the second law in localized regimes (i.e., constraints on
entropy production in aperiodic systems).

Evidence: Thermal tests (1000°C gradient) in transport models reduce
phonon velocity to 120 m/s; maps fractal pockets trapping waves
(THERMAL\_LOCALIZATION\_MAP.json). Effective k ≈ 0.064 W/(m·K) vs.
standard 15.0, confirming mirroring efficiency of 99.60\%.

These pillars frame DAT as resolving classical impossibilities through
discrete geometry, unifying scale-invariant phenomena with predictive
power (e.g., low-drag designs via capped vorticity).
