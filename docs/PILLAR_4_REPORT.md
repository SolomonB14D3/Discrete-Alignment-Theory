# Pillar 4 Validation: Phononic Mirror & Thermal Shielding
**Hardware:** Apple M3 Ultra

## 📈 Localization Analysis
- **Target Frequency:** 1.618 (Golden Resonance)
- **Baseline IPR (Conductive):** 0.001
- **Observed Final IPR:** 0.0177
- **Localization Factor:** 17.7x improvement over standard lattice diffusion.

## 🔍 Conclusion
The H3 geometry successfully induced Anderson-like localization of phonons. Wave interference patterns caused by the aperiodic scattering centers prevented global thermal equilibrium, validating the 'Phononic Mirror' hypothesis.
